## Description
This project runs a flask app that prints the IP address of the container its running on, and an Nginx webserver that acts as a round-robin load balancer.

1. run the app.py locally to validate it running and exposing IP address of the flask server on port 5000. Make sure you have flask module installed.
2. build a container from the dockerfile using `docker build -t flask .` 
3. run the container using `docker run -it -u gil -p 5000:5000 flask bash`
4. within the bash of the running container, run: `python3 app.py`
5. the flask app should run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` click on the URL and validate the browser prints "172.17.0.2"
